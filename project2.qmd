# Project 2

Project 2 challenges you to

-   Either modify the process model to better represent an ecosystem process or include a new process that is missing, or
-   Apply the process model to a new NEON site.

You are ask to provide a kitted R markdown (or Quarto) document with text, code, and plots following:

-   Your forest process model
-   Parameter estimation either using likelihood, Bayesian batch, or particle filter methods
-   A 30-day ahead forecast using your model
